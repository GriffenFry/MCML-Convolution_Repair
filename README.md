# MCML-Convolution_Repair
A fix to the Convolution operations of the Monte Carlo Multi-Layered software created by Lihong Wang and Steven Jacques. 

The original version required the output file already exists, this new version will create the new file if it doesnt exist, while keeping the same prompt order whether or not it exists so that scripts to run the program don't break. 

The original code can be found at https://omlc.org/software/mc/mcml/
